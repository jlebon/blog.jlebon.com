## How to

Write posts in `posts/`, build using `make`, test locally
with `make serve`.

Building requires Node.js. Install deps with `npm install`.

## Why not just use Jekyll or \<other static generator\>?

I tried using Jekyll + GitHub Pages and while it kinda
worked, getting it set up for local dev was a pain and it
just felt like overkill for what I wanted.

I also like exploring the fundamentals in my pet projects
and starting from the simplest form possible. For example,
this blog uses no JavaScript at runtime. Code highlighting
is done at build-time.
